		<h3>[ My (stupid) cross-platform note-taking solution ]</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Recently I come across a problem - I actually want to be able to take notes on every single device of mine, whenever I want. I mainly work on apple devices, but I do have a linux laptop I quite like. Essentially, I want an cross-platform app that is lightweight, sync-abe, and easy to use. My eventual solution seems to be <strong>staying with Google Keep</strong>, but... below is why I do not prefer other alternatives -</p>
		<p><strong>A text editor (**VIM forever**) and a sync app</strong> - I like VIM, this is the first solution comes on top of my head. However, I am not a geek that lives in VIM and do coding on every single day, thus typing all the time in VIM does not look right to me... Another thing is, there is no "official" or even a decent solution for mounting a Google Drive to my linux desktop, disfavoring the solution of using VIM + cloud drive (Google Drive in my case). People use "Syncthing" to sync folders between different devices, but its UI does not look lightweight and does intimidate me.</p>
		<p><strong>Evernote or anything like that</strong> - too heavy, too fancy for me. Even Simplenote, I do feel it is a heavy app. I do not need that many features. If taking the features into account, I do think the Microsoft OneNote is the best, but it is not a "real" cross-platform app. I will need something like WINE to run it, and before that I need to have a legal copy of the OneNote... Anyway, give up!</p>
