    <h4 style="text-align:center;"> Postdoctoral Research </h4>
    <p> My current research mainly focuses on dissecting the phosphoregulatory
    network that guides and shapes meiotic progression, using <a
                                     href="introElegans.html"><em>C.
                                         elegans</em></a> as the
    model system. </p>

    <p> Working with Dr. Abby Dernburg, I employ genetic,
    cytological, together with genome-scale quantitative methods simultaneously
    in my study. With my efforts, I aim to gain a better understanding of how
    meiosis is performed and regulated, in that beautiful way. </p>

    <h4 style="text-align:center;"> Graduate Research (II) </h4>
    <p> During my graduate training at IBP, my work has been focusing on a specified
    chromosomal region called centromere. Centromere is the place where kinetochore
    assembles during each mitotic cell cycle. It must be tightly regulated in
    order to accurately segregate the chromosomes. </p>

    <p> Mentored by Dr. Guohong Li, I've been studying this topic through looking at a
    reversible phosphorylation event that takes place on the centromere
    determinant called CENP-A. This project was partially inspired by the crystal
    structure of CENP-A with its chaperone, HJURP. The latter work is led by
    Dr. Rui-Ming Xu's Group.</p>

    <h4 style="text-align:center;"> Graduate Research (I) </h4>
    <p> I've been studying a family of enzymes called phenylacetic acid-CoA
    ligases. By doing simple yet straightforward enzymetic kinetics, I learned
    fundamental experiment skills from Dr. Fu-Qiang Wang. I've also been
    working in Dr. Baohua Zhao's Lab for a year where I learned some knowledge
    of Immunity. </p>

    <h4 style="text-align:center;"> Undergrad and before </h4>
    <p> I was a rock music fan and barely study, so I was not a hardworking student. ~ :) </p>
    <p> Never thought about being a scientist. Anyone can! - not me! ~ :D </p>
